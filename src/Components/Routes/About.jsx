        <div>
          <h2>Introduction to E-commerce</h2>
          <p>
            E-commerce, or electronic commerce, refers to the buying and selling
            of goods or services using the internet. It encompasses a wide range
            of business activities, including online retail, online banking, and
            online auctions. E-commerce has revolutionized the way businesses
            operate and interact with consumers, offering convenience, a broader
            market reach, and the ability to conduct business 24/7.
          </p>

          <h3>Evolution of E-commerce</h3>
          <p>
            E-commerce began in the 1960s with the advent of Electronic Data
            Interchange (EDI), which allowed businesses to exchange documents
            electronically. The real growth of e-commerce started in the 1990s
            with the commercialization of the internet. Notable milestones
            include the launch of Amazon in 1995 and eBay in 1995. The
            development of secure online payment systems, such as PayPal,
            further accelerated the growth of e-commerce.
